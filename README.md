# NoiseModel

The implementation of CVPR 2020 (Oral) paper "[A Physics-based Noise Formation Model for Extreme Low-light Raw Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12751)"


## Highlights

* We present a highly accurate noise formation model based on the characteristics of CMOS photosensors, thereby enabling us to synthesize realistic samples that better match the physics of image formation process.

* To study the generalizability of a neural network trained with existing schemes, we introduce a new Extreme Low-light Denoising (ELD) dataset that covers four representative modern camera devices for *evaluation* purposes only. The image capture setup and example images are shown as below:

* By training only with our synthetic data, we demonstrate a convolutional neural network can compete with or sometimes even outperform the network trained with paired real data under extreme low-light settings. The denoising results of networks trained with multiple schemes, i.e. 1) synthetic data generated by the poissonian-gaussian noise model, 2) paired read data of [SID dataset](https://github.com/cchen156/Learning-to-See-in-the-Dark) and 3) synthetic data generated by our proposed noise model, are displayed as follows:
